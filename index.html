    <h1>Our Story Comes First</h1>
    <p>
      The Divine Foods did not begin as a brand.
      It began as a responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Built by a family that values trust over trends, we believe food should
      never need explanation — only integrity. Every decision we make is rooted
      in hygiene, compliance, and respect for the people who consume what we pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you explore our products, we invite you to understand why we exist.

    <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
    <p>
      Food is not a commodity to us. It is a promise.
      A promise that what reaches your home has been handled responsibly
      at every stage — sourcing, processing, and packaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a family-owned business, we operate without shortcuts.
      We choose compliance even when it is inconvenient.
      We choose hygiene even when it costs more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our systems are built around accountability.
      Our suppliers are audited.
      Our facilities follow FSSAI-aligned processes.
      And our packaging reflects restraint, not excess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only after understanding this philosophy do we believe our products
      should speak for themselves.

    <h2>From Responsibility to Product</h2>
    <p>
      What we pack is a direct outcome of how we operate.
      No artificial enhancement. No exaggerated claims.
      Only clean, traceable dry fruits and nuts.
